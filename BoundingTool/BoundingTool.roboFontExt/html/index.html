<h1>Bounding Tool</h1>

 
<p>A subclass of the Robofont Editing Tool, Bounding Tool helps you visualize the bounding box of your current glyph. It is especially helpful if you are trying to center something, or divide something evenly into halves, thirds, or quarters.</p>
<p>The dialog box gives you some options:</p>

<dl>

<dt>View All or Selected</dt>
<dd>Toggle between getting the bounding box for the entire glyph vs. the current selection. The entire glyph is useful for centering accents, etc.</dd>

<dt>View X and/or Y (checkboxes)</dt>
<dd>Toggle on/off the x and y axis.</dd>

<dt>Number of Divisions</dt>
<dd>Choose whether to split the bounding box into halves, thirds, or quarters.</dd>

<dt>Div Guides</dt>
<dd>Convert the current divisions into guides, which will stick around after the tool is deactivated.</dd>

<dt>Box Guides</dt>
<dd>Convert the bounding box square into guides, which will stick around after the tool is deactivated.</dd>
