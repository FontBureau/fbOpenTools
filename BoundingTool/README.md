<p>A subclass of the Robofont Editing Tool, Bounding Tool helps you visualize. It is especially helpful in half-way marks. </p>

<p>The dialog box gives you some options:</p>

<dl>

<dt>View All or Selected</dt>
<dd>Toggle between getting the bounding box for the entire glyph vs. the current selection. The entire glyph is useful for centering accents, etc.</dd>

<dt>View X and/or Y (checkboxes)</dt>
<dd>Toggle on/off the x and y axis.</dd>

<dt>Number of Divisions</dt>
<dd>Choose whether to split the bounding box into halves, thirds, or quarters.</dd>

<dt>Div Guides</dt>
<dd>Convert the current divisions into guides, which will stick around after the tool is deactivated.</dd>

<dt>Box Guides</dt>
<dd>Convert the bounding box square into guides, which will stick around after the tool is deactivated.</dd>
