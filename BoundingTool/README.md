<p>A subclass of the Robofont Editing Tool, Bounding Tool helps you visualize the bounding box of your current glyph. It will also display the box's dimensions, thanks to <a href="http://www.ninastoessinger.com/?l=e">Nina St√∂ssinger</a>. You can use the division sliders if you are trying to center something, or divide something evenly into halves, thirds, or quarters.</p>

<p>Note: I changed some things that might cause the icon to disappear when you install the new version. To fix this, uninstall your existing version of Bounding Tool (listed in Prefs > Extensions > Extensions), Quit RoboFont, reopen RoboFont, and finally, drag the latest BoundingTool.roboFontExt. Sorry for the trouble.</p>


<p>The dialog box gives you some options:</p>

<dl>

<dt>View All or Selected</dt>
<dd>Toggle between getting the bounding box for the entire glyph vs. the current selection. The entire glyph is useful for centering accents, etc.</dd>

<dt>Use Italic</dt>
<dd>Use the font's italic angle to display a slanted bounding box.</dd>


<dt>View X and/or Y (checkboxes)</dt>
<dd>Toggle on/off the x and y axis.</dd>

<dt>Number of Divisions</dt>
<dd>Choose whether to split the bounding box into halves, thirds, or quarters, or to not split it.</dd>

<dt>Show Coordinates</dt>
<dd>Toggle the display of bounding coordinates.</dd>

<dt>Show Dimensions</dt>
<dd>Toggle the display of the bounding box's dimensions.</dd>


<dt>Div Guides</dt>
<dd>Convert the current divisions into guides, which will stick around after the tool is deactivated.</dd>

<dt>Box Guides</dt>
<dd>Convert the bounding box square into guides, which will stick around after the tool is deactivated.</dd>
