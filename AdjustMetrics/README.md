<p>Adjust Metrics was created in 2012 by David Jonathan Ross for Font Bureau. It may or may not work the way you want it to.</p> 

   
<p>Adjust both margins, left margin, or right margin...</p>
<p>To current glyph selection or all glyphs</p>
<p>In current font or a selection of opened fonts</p>
    
<h2>Options:</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Adjust components (on by default):</dt> <dd>If 'A' is selected but not 'Aacute', 'Aacute' will be shifted back so it does not affect the original position.</dd>
    
<dt>Adjust Comps with Selected (off by default):</dt> <dd>If 'A' is selected, also transform 'Aacute' et. al.</dd>
</dl>
