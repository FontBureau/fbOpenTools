<p>In the current glyph window, this extension will provide a readout of the how far your mouse has been dragged. Installing it will activate it; it doesn’t appear in menus.</p>

<p>Theoretically it should work alongside any tool: edit, pen, knife, measure, etc. For some reason I have been getting weird results with the Shape Tool though.</p>

<p>I am open to suggestions on where to position the readout so it is least disruptive. I was thinking about putting it in the top left corner of the window, but I’m not not sure how to position something relative to the window instead of the glyph origin.</p>
