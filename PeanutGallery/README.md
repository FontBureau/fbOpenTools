<p>WARNING: THIS IS A BETA VERSION. This extension is still very much in development, and is a little rough around the edges. Your comments are welcome, and your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>This tool provides a commenting interface for Robofont. The comments are stored in each glyph’s lib.</p>

<p>Double clicking anywhere in the glyph window will load a comment dialog. You can pick a symbol and/or type a text-based comment. You can use, but U+1F4A9 is not an option (let’s keep our comments civil, people.) Use the right arrow to save the comment (I can’t figure out how to bind the Enter key). Once created, comments can be dragged in the glyph window. Double-click on a comment’s icon to edit or remove it.</p>

<p>A log of all comments for a font can be viewed in the Commentary window. Use the refresh button to load the most recent comments (still trying to figure out how to make it automatically refresh).</p>

<p>When reviewing comments, simply click on any comment in the Commentary window and your Current Glyph Window will be transported to that glyph and that comment will be highlighted. Marking a comment done will change its color from red to blue.</p>

<p>By default, Comment will change the Current Glyph Window’s view settings. Use the eyeballs button in the commentary window to toggle the view. The view settings will return to normal when the comment window is deactivated.</p>

<h3>To do</h3>

<ul>
<li>Automatically refresh commentary window</li>
<li>Better keystroke binding for quick commenting</li>
<li>Show/hide/delete comments marked as "done"</li>
<li>Font-level comments</li>
</ul>
