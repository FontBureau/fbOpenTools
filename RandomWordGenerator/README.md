<p>This extension sticks a string of random words into your current space center. The computer sometimes has a sick mind, so don’t blame me for offensive words! If a space center is not open, it will simply print the random words into the output window.</p>

<p>A small UI is provided that allows you to increase or decrease word count, and change the case. There is also a way to omit glyphs that do not exist in the font.</p>

<p>Since this only acts on the Current Space Center, you have to manually adjust something to set the words in multiple space centers.</p>

<p>Future improvements could include support for multiple languages (though this is English and I still don’t understand three quarters of the words). And Nick suggested a function that selects words based on the existing glyphs, as opposed to just omitting them.</p>
