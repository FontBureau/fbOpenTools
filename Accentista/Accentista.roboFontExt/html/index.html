<h1>Accentista</h1>

<p>This extension overlays combining or floating accents over the Current Glyph, based on the name and position of the anchors. As you move an anchor, the accent visualization will move with it. This extension is tailored very closely to my naming habits and workflow, so your mileage my vary. The goal is to store all the knowledge about accents in the base glyphs, so I have to do as little fiddling as possible in the accent glyphs.</p>

<p>I am working on an upgrade of this tool that will also build and update the accent glyphs that it visualizes.</p>

<p>If your accent glyphs are already built, the extension will allow you to compare your existing composite glyph to what would be generated using the anchor positioning.</p>

<p>The interface gives you basic options for fill, stroke, and color. It also allows you to toggle the left, center, and right vertical guides. If you select one or more accents in the list, only those accents will be visualized in the Glyph Window. The reset button will return the glyph to its default view.</p>

<p>By default, the extension looks for anchors named "top" and "bottom", corresponding to "_top" and "_bottom" anchors in the combining/floating accents themselves. Double clicking on an accent in the list will create a new anchor specifically for that diacritic (for example, "top_acutecmb"), which is helpful with ogoneks and carons that don't sit with other accents.</p>
