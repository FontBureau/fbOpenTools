<h1>OverlayUFOs</h1>

<p>OverlayUFOs was created in 2012 by David Jonathan Ross for Font Bureau. It may or may not work the way you want it to.</p>

<p>In the current glyph window, this will present a view of the same glyph from a separate UFO or set of UFOs.</p>

<p>This does NOT import the UFO into a background layer. Instead, it renders a outline directly from the UFO into the glyph window view.</p>

<p>I use this to compare a typeface across styles, or to check for consistency within a family.</p>

<ul>

<li>There is no need to import duplicate data into a background layer.</li>

<li>The source outline is always live; when changes are made to the source, they will automatically appear in the current without re-importing.</li>

<li>The source font does not need to be opened with the Robofont UI.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Dialog</h2>
    
A floating dialog is present to let you open and select source fonts, fill, stroke, color.</p>

<p>Source Fonts: The default source font list is AllFonts() at the time the dialog is opened. The refresh button will return this list to AllFonts().</p>

<p>Adding Fonts: You can manually add fonts by selecting a UFO file. To save time and reduce clutter, the UFO will open without a Robofont interface.</p>

<p>Removing Fonts: There are buttons for removing selected fonts and for clearing the source font list. </p>

<h2>Bugs/Improvements</h2>

<p>Possible Issue? The source font is drawn on top of the current font, instead of behind it. So, it is good to select a color with a low opacity.</p>

<p>Known Bug: If the glyph window for both source and current fonts are open, it is possible to select and inadvertently edit the source outline in the current window. I don't know how to solve this.</p>

<p>Possible Improvement? Add options to scale the source font.</p>

<p>Possible Improvement? Set different colors, fill settings for each font?</p>
