<p>In the current glyph window, this will present a view of the same glyph from a separate UFO or set of UFOs.</p>

<p>This does NOT import the UFO into a background layer. Instead, it renders a outline directly from the UFO into the glyph window view.</p>

<p>I use this to compare a typeface across styles, or to check for consistency within a family.</p>

<ul>

<li>There is no need to import duplicate data into a background layer.</li>

<li>The source outline is always live; when changes are made to the source, they will automatically appear in the current without re-importing.</li>

<li>The source font does not need to be opened with the Robofont UI.</li>

</ul>
    
<p>A floating dialog is present to let you open and select source fonts, fill, stroke, color.</p>

<p>Source Fonts: The default source font list is AllFonts() at the time the dialog is opened. The refresh button will return this list to AllFonts().</p>

<p>Adding Fonts: You can manually add fonts by selecting a UFO file. To save time and reduce clutter, the UFO will open without a Robofont interface.</p>

<p>Removing Fonts: There are buttons for removing selected fonts and for clearing the source font list. </p>
