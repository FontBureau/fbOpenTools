<p>In the current glyph window, this extension will unobtrusively display a readout of the unicode character represented by the current glyph, its hex unicode value(s), and the unicode name.</p>

<p>This is especially handy to reference when you are working with hard-to-use glyph names, unfamiliar characters, or alternate glyphs that do not contain unicode values.</p>

<p>If no unicodes are assigned to a glyph, the extension guesses the character(s) it represents by examines the glyph’s base name. It is not perfect, but should be able to approximate character information by interpreting uniXXXX/uXXXXX glyph names and by looking in the Adobe Glyph List. Approximated unicode values are marked with a tilde (~).</p>

<p>The extension will also analyze the glyph name’s suffix and display feature information, such as Small Caps and Stylistic Alternates.</p>

<p>If multiple values are assigned, all values will be shown along with the primary character name. If a glyph represents multiple characters (a ligature, for example), the character string will reflect that.</p>

<p>Installing this extension will activate it; it doesn’t appear in menus.</p>
